# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

This analysis was made with the purpose of helping Bobby’s manager and the company to prepare before the retirement wave comes.
After the 6 csv data arrived we had to figure out how we can organize them and then create the relationships between the data. 

Using quickDBD we create a diagram that helps us along the road with those relationships.

After we had the idea of how will be performed, we proceeded to create a local database and then the SQL.

Using the query editor to write the code we star filtering the information to create more tables with the information needed and then export the data in a CSV that way is easier to get access to the data with EXCEL.

### We can divide the process in 3 steps:
      •	IMPORT DATA
      •	FILTER/ COMBINE 
      •	EXPORT

## SALES AND DEVELOPMENT
      •	Need to prepare for the silver tsunami that will take with it 15142 employees from both 
      •	Mentorships need to start the mentorship program right away if they want to minimize the damage

## MENTORSHIP
      •	If mentorship program is executed on time PH can minimize the risk of the company to stop the normal flow but still get affected because now the company have 10%         of mentorship eligibility against the 15142 of retirements in the Sales and Development Departments
